        <p>Hello! I'm Nélida, and I live in Arequipa, Perú. At 24 years old, what I'm most passionate about is the
            architecture and logic behind software development. I am currently studying the Software Development degree.
            I'm not just interested in writing code, but in building robust solutions. My excitement for learning new
            technologies is my driving force, and if something is new, I'm ready to master it.</p>

            <p>"Vinicunca, known as the Seven Colors Mountain or Rainbow Mountain, is a breathtaking peak at 5,200
                meters
                (17,060 ft) above sea level in the Peruvian Andes of the Cusco region. Its vibrant stripes are the
                result
                of a complex mineralogical composition formed by marine, lake, and river sediments dating back millions
                of
                years. It is a sacred destination near the Ausangate snow-capped mountain." - wiki</p>
