        <p>Hello! I'm Nélida, and I live in Arequipa, Perú. At 24 years old, what I'm most passionate about is the
            architecture and logic behind software development.
            I am currently studying the Software Development degree. I'm not just interested in writing code, but in
            building robust solutions.
            My excitement for learning new technologies is my driving force, and if something is new, I'm ready to
            master it..</p>

    <p>"Vinicunca, known as the Seven Colors Mountain
        or Rainbow
        Mountain, is a breathtaking peak at 5,200 meters
        (17,060
        ft) above sea level in the Peruvian Andes of the Cusco region. Its vibrant stripes are the result of a
        complex
        mineralogical composition formed by marine, lake, and river sediments dating back millions of years. It is a
        sacred destination near the Ausangate snow-capped mountain." - wiki</p>
